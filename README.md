# Public API Requests Employee Directory
An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

This project employs the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and uses that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

It requests JSON object from the API and parses the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

Frameworks, libraries or plugins were not permitted. While there are plugins that can help with the creation of a gallery and modal setup, this project helped me understand how tools like that work "under the hood".
